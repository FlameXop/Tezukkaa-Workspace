            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p>Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase.</p>

            <h2>No Refunds</h2>
            <p>Because Tezuka Planner offers a <strong>comprehensive 3-day free trial</strong> with full access to all features, we maintain a <strong>strict no-refund policy</strong> on all paid subscriptions (Monthly, Yearly, and Lifetime).</p>
            
            <p>We encourage you to utilize the free trial period to ensure that the software meets your needs before committing to a purchase.</p>

            <h2>Cancellations</h2>
            <p>You may cancel your Monthly or Yearly subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing cycle, after which you will not be charged again.</p>

            <h2>Exceptions</h2>
            <p>If you were charged due to a technical error (e.g., double charge), please contact support immediately for a resolution.</p>
